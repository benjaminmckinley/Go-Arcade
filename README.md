# Go-Arcade
A graphical implementation of the classic multiplayer strategy game Go.
--
Players take turns placing pieces of their color down on the board. If a piece or group
of same color pieces have no liberties or connections to a vacant, non-edge space after 
a particular move, the group or individual piece is removed from the board. The winner is
decided by who has the most stones when the players decide to finish the game.

Suicide moves or moves that allow a player to jeopardize their own pieces are not allowed.

The board is resizable between games and all high scores are recorded with the winning players initials.
